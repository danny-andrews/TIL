# Knowledge Base
A collection of tips, tricks, concepts, lessons-learned, best practices, and framework-specific knowledge I've gathered over my career.

[TODO: combine this repo with my blog, so I can make relative links to blog posts from my knowledge base without having to copy and paste content or rely on the hosted version]
