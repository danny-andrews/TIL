**Cons**
Globals
Magic (auto mocking, auto transpiling of **source** code, not just test code)
Encourages bad design by providing ability to mock out entire modules (why?)
No custom assertion message (wtf!?)
Aliases

**Pros**
Optimized for running React components very quickly (Ava struggles with this)
